# Object Detection and Tracking System using YOLO v8
<h3>Overview</h3>
This project focuses on developing a state-of-the-art object detection and tracking system leveraging the YOLO v8 model. Designed to identify and track multiple objects in real-time, the system achieves over 75% accuracy and processes video at 30 frames per second (FPS). The project utilizes diverse datasets to ensure robust performance and broad applicability.
